# **App Name**: TravelMate PWA

## Core Features:

- PWA Manifest: Develop a fully functional manifest.json to define the PWA characteristics: name, short name (Travely), description, start URL, display mode (standalone), background color, theme color, and placeholder icons.
- Service Worker: Implement a basic service-worker.js for caching static assets (HTML, CSS, main JS, logo, and icons) using the 'Cache First' strategy. Include install and fetch events with comprehensive comments.
- Homepage Design: Create a homepage (`index.html`) featuring a header with the 'Travely' logo and navigation (Destinations, My Bookings, Help, Login), a hero section with an image and search bar, sections for popular destinations, activity types, and unique selling points, and a footer with informative links, social media icons, and copyright information.
- Activities List: Design an activities listing page (`activities-list.html`) with consistent header and footer, a title indicating the destination, filters for activity type, price, and ratings with an 'Apply' button, and a grid layout displaying activity cards with image, title, duration, rating, price range, and a 'View Details' button.
- Activity Detail: Develop an activity details page (`activity-detail.html`) with a consistent header and footer, activity title, image gallery (simple carousel), a booking section with a calendar, people selector, total price placeholder, a 'Book Now' button, and tabs for Description, Inclusions, Exclusions, Meeting Point, and Reviews.
- Documentation: Thoroughly document the project in a `README.md` file, providing a description, color palette, file structure, and a summary of the PWA features. Include extensive comments in Spanish within HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and service-worker.js files to explain the code structure and functionality.
- Full Frontend Structure: Generate the complete frontend structure for 'Travely', a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for booking tourist activities, similar to Civitatis.com.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Travel Blue (#0A74DA) to reflect trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F8F9FA), providing a neutral backdrop that ensures readability and visual comfort.
- Accent color: Adventure Turquoise (#17A2B8), approximately 30 degrees to the left of Travel Blue on the color wheel, will highlight interactive elements and important calls to action.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for UI elements.
- Use a set of consistent and recognizable icons in SVG format for key features and actions. For the social media section in the page footer, provide external links to associated destinations.
- A consistent and responsive layout across all pages
